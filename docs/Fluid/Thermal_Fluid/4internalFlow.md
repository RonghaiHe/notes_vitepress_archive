# Internal Flows
## Introduction

1. Liquid or gas **flow through pipes or ducts** is commonly used in heating and cooling applications and fluid distribution networks
2. The fluid in such applications is usually **forced to flow by a fan or a pump** through a flow section.
3. We pay particular attention to **friction**, which is directly related to **pressure drop** and **head loss** during flow through pipes and ducts
4. The **pressure drop** is then used to determine the **pumping power requirement**.

**Circular pipes** can withstand **large pressure difference** between the **inside** and **outside** without undergoing any significant distortion.

However:
1. Theoretical solutions are obtained only for a few simple cases such as **fully developed laminar flow** in a circular pipe
2. Therefore, we must rely on **experimental results and empirical relations** for most fluidflow problem rather than closed-form analytical solutions.

The value of the average velocity $V_{\mathrm{avg}}$ at some streamwise cross-section is determined from the requirement that the **conservation of mass principle** be satisfied:

$$
  \begin{gather*}
    \dot{m} = \rho V_{\mathrm{avg}}A_c = \int_{A_c}\rho u(r)\mathrm{d}A_c.\\
    V_{\mathrm{avg}} = \frac{\int_{A_c}\rho u(r)\mathrm{d}A_c}{\rho A_c} = \frac{\int_0^R \rho u(r)2\pi r\mathrm{d}r}{\rho\pi R^2} = \frac{2}{R^2}\int_0^R u(r)r\mathrm{d}r
  \end{gather*}
$$

<img src="/fluid_tf4_1_average_v.png" alt="average speed" width="100%" align="center">

Average velocity $V_{\mathrm{avg}}$ is defined as the average speed through a cross section. For **fully developed laminar** pipe flow, $V_{\mathrm{avg}}$ is half of the maximum velocity: 

$$V_{\mathrm{avg}} = \frac12 V_{\mathrm{max}}$$

## Laminar and Turbulent Flows
### Laminar Flow in Pipes

We consider **steady**, **laminar**, **incompressible** flow of a fluid with **constant** properties in the fully developed region of a **straight circular pipe**.

In fully developed laminar flow:
- each fluid particle moves at a **constant axial velocity** along a streamline and the **velocity profile** $u(r)$ remains unchanged in the flow direction. 

$$
\begin{gather*}
  u(r) = 2V_{\mathrm{avg}}\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2}\right) \\
  u_{\mathrm{max}} = 2V_{\mathrm{avg}}
\end{gather*}
$$

- There is **no motion in the radial direction**, and thus the velocity component in the direction normal to the pipe axis is everywhere zero. 
- There is **no acceleration** since the flow is steady and fully developed.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_2_steady_v.png" alt="steady internal flow" width="100%" align="center">

### Laminar and Turbulent Flows

- **Laminar**: smooth streamlines and highly ordered motion
  - Laminar flow is encountered when **highly viscous** fluids such as oils flow in **small** pipes or **narrow** passages.
- **Transition**: the flow fluctuates between laminar and turbulent flows.
  - In the transitional flow region, the flow **switches** between laminar and turbulent seemingly **random**.
- **Turbulent**: ...
  - Most flows encountered in practice are turbulent

<img src="/fluid_tf4_3_example.JPG" alt="example" width="100%" align="center">

### Reynolds Number

The Reynolds number can be viewed as the **ratio** of **inertial forces** to **viscous forces** acting on a fluid element.

$$
  \operatorname{Re} = \frac{\mathrm{Internal Forces}}{\mathrm{Viscous Forces}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{avg}}D}{v} = \frac{\rho V_{\mathrm{avg}}D}{\mu}.
$$

- At **small** Reynolds numbers, the viscous forces are large enough to suppress these fluctuations and to keep the fluid ‘in line’ (**laminar**).
- At **large** Reynolds numbers, the inertial forces, which are promotional to the fluid density and the fluid velocity, are large relative to viscous forces cannot prevent the viscous forces, and thus the random and rapid fluctuations of the fluid (**turbulent**).

Critical Reynolds number, $\operatorname{Re}_{\mathrm{cr}}$: the Reynolds number at which the flow **becomes turbulent**
- The value of critical Reynolds number is different for different geometries and flow conditions
- For **flow in circular pipe**:
  $$\begin{array}{rlr}&\operatorname{Re}  \lesssim 2300 & \text { laminar flow } \\ 2300 \lesssim & \operatorname{Re} \lesssim 10,000 & \text { transitional flow } \\ &\operatorname{Re}  \gtrsim 10,000 & \text { turbulent flow }\end{array}$$

About the calculation of $D$: For flow through noncircular pipes, the Reynolds number is based on the **hydraulic diameter** $D_H$ (水力直径):

$$
  D_H = \frac{4A_c}{p}.
$$

where $A_c$ is the cross-sectional area of the flow, $p$ is the perimeter of the cross-section. And for crcular pipes, it reduces to ordinary diameter.

- Circular tube with diameter $D$
  $$D_H = \frac{4(\pi D^2/4)}{\pi D} = D$$
- Square duct with $a\times a$:
  $$D_H = \frac{4a^2}{4a} = a$$
- Rectangular duct with $a\times b$:
  $$D_H = \frac{4ab}{2(a+b)} = \frac{2ab}{a+b}$$
- Channel with width $b$ and height of fluid $a$ (not full, the height of channel is larger than $a$):
  $$D_H = \frac{4ab}{2a+b}$$

## The Entrance Region

- **Velocity boundary layer**: The region of the flow in which the effects of the **viscous shearing forces** caused by fluid viscosity are felt.
- **Boundary layer region**: The **viscous** effects and the **velocity changes** are significant.
- **Irrotational (core) flow region**: The frictional effects are negligible and the **velocity remains essentially constant** in the **radial** direction.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_4_pipe_layer.JPG" alt="pipe_layer" width="100%" align="center">

The development of the velocity boundary layer in a pipe. The developed average velocity profile is parabolic in laminar flow, but somewhat flatter or fuller in turbulent flow.

- **Hydrodynamic entrance region**: The region from the pipe inlet to the point at which the boundary layer merges at the **centerline**: $V(r,x)$
  - **Hydrodynamic entry length** $L_h$: The length of this region.
  - **Hydrodynamically developing flow**: Flow in the entrance region. This is the region where the velocity profile develops.
- **Hydrodynamically fully developed region**: The region beyond the entrance region in which the **velocity profile** is fully developed and remains **unchanged**: $V(r)$
  - **Fully developed**: When both the **velocity profile** and the **normalized temperature profile** remain unchanged.
  $$
    \frac{\partial u(r,x)}{\partial x}=0 \implies u=u(r).
  $$

  In the fully developed flow region of a pipe, the velocity profile does not change downstream, and thus the wall shear stress $\tau_w$ remains constant as well. 

<img src="/fluid_tf4_5_pressure.png" alt="pressure" width="100%" align="center">

### Entry Lengths

The hydrodynamic entry length $L_h$ is usually taken to be the **distance** from the **pipe entrance** to where the **wall shear stress** (and thus the friction factor)reaches within about **2 percent** of the fully developed value.

1. For laminar flow:
  $$\frac{L_{h,\mathrm{laminar}}}{D}\cong0.05\mathrm{Re}$$
2. For turbulent flow:
  $$\frac{L_{h,\mathrm{laminar}}}{D}=1.359\mathrm{Re}^{1/4}$$

- The pipes used in practice are usually several times the length of the entrance region, and thus the flow through the pipes is **often assumed to be fully developed** for the entire length of the pipe
- This simplistic approach gives reasonable results for long pipes but sometimes poor results for short ones since it underpredicts the wall shear stress and thus the friction factor

## Laminar Flow in pipes
### Pressure Drop and Head Loss

<img src="/fluid_tf4_6_pressure_drop.png" alt="pressure drop" width="100%" align="center">

A quantity of interest in the analysis of pipe flow is the pressure drop $\Delta P$ since it is directly related to the **power requirements of the fan or pump to maintain flow**. We note that $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}x = \mathrm{constant}$, and integrating from $x= x_1 + L$ where the pressure $P_2$ gives

$$
  \frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}x} = \frac{P_2 - P_1}{L}
$$

For the laminar flow:
$$
  \Delta P = P_1 - P_2 = \frac{8\mu LV_{\mathrm{avg}}}{R^2} = \frac{32\mu LV_{\mathrm{avg}}}{D^2}.
$$

::: warning Definition: pressure loss
A pressure drop due to **viscous effects** represents an **irreversible** pressure loss, and it is called **pressure loss** $\Delta P_L$:
$$
  \Delta P_L = f\frac{L}{D}\frac{\rho V_{\mathrm{avg}}^2}{2}.
$$

for all types of **fully developed internal flows**, where $f$ is the **Darcy friction factor**:
$$
  f = \frac{8\tau_w}{\rho V_{\mathrm{avg}}^2}.
$$

:::

For laminar flow in the circular pipe:
$$
  f = \frac{64\mu}{\rho DV_{\mathrm{avg}}} = \frac{64}{\operatorname{Re}}.
$$

In **laminar flow**, the **friction factor** is a function of the **Reynolds number only** and is **independent** of the roughness of the pipe surface.

::: warning Definition: head loss
The **head loss** represents the **additional height** that the fluid needs to be raised by a pump in order to overcome the **frictional losses** in the pipe:
$$
  h_L = \frac{\Delta P_L}{\rho g} = f\frac{L}{D}\frac{V_{\mathrm{avg}}^2}{2g}.
$$

:::

The relation for pressure loss (and head loss)is one of the most general relations in fluid mechanics, and it is valid for laminar or turbulent flows, circular or noncircular pipes, and pipes with smooth or rough surfaces 

For horizonal pipe:
$$
  \dot{W}_{\mathrm{pump},L} = \dot{V}\Delta P_L=\dot{V}{\rho}gh_L=\dot{m}gh_L
$$

where:
$$
  V_{\mathrm{avg}}=\frac{(P_{1}-P_{2})R^{2}}{8\mu L}=\frac{(P_{1}-P_{2})D^{2}}{32\mu L}=\frac{\Delta PD^{2}}{32\mu L}
$$

and the volume flow rate $\dot{V}$ (Poiseuill's Law):
$$
  \dot{V}=V_{\mathrm{avg}}A_{c}=\frac{(P_{1}-P_{2})R^{2}}{8\mu L}\pi R^{2}=\frac{(P_{1}-P_{2})\pi D^{4}}{128\mu L}=\frac{\Delta P\pi D^{4}}{128\mu L}.
$$

<img src="/fluid_tf4_7_power.JPG" alt="power requirement" width="100%" align="center">

The pumping power requirement for a laminar flow piping system can be reduced by a factor of $16$ by doubling the pipe diameter.

The pressure drop $\Delta P$ equals the pressure loss $\Delta P_L$ in the case of a **horizontal pipe**, but this is not the case for **inclined pipes** or **pipes with variable cross-sectional area**

This can be demonstrated by writing the energy equation for steady, imcompressible one-dimensional flow in terms of heads as
$$
  \begin{gather*}
    \frac{P_{1}}{\rho g}+\alpha_{1}\frac{V_{1}^{2}}{2g}+z_{1}+h_{\mathrm{pump,}u}=\frac{P_{2}}{\rho g}+\alpha_{2}\frac{V_{2}^{2}}{2g}+z_{2}+h_{\mathrm{turbine,}e}+h_{L}\\
    P_{1}-P_{2}=\rho(\alpha_{2}V_{2}^{2}-\alpha_{1}V_{1}^{2})/2+\rho g[(z_{2}-z_{1})+h_{\mathrm{turbine,}e}-h_{\mathrm{pump,}u}+h_{L}]
  \end{gather*}
$$

### Examples1: Laminar Flow in Horizonal Pipes

Consider the fully developed flow of glycerin at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ through a $70-\mathrm{m}$-long, $4-\mathrm{cm}$-diameter, horizontal, circular pipe. If the flow velocity at the centerline is measured to be $6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, determine the velocity profile and the pressure difference across this $70-\mathrm{m}$-long section of the pipe, and the useful pumping power required to maintain this flow.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_9_example1.JPG" alt="example1" width="100%" align="center">

**Properties**: The density and dynamic viscosity of glycerin at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ are $\rho=1252 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ and $\mu=0.3073 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}$, respectively.

**Analysis**: The **velocity profile** in **fully developed laminar flow** in a **circular pipe** is expressed as

$$
u(r)=u_{\max }\left(1-\frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}}\right)
$$

Substituting, the velocity profile is determined to be

$$
u(r)=(6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})\left(1-\frac{r^{2}}{(0.02 \mathrm{~m})^{2}}\right)=6\left(1-2500 r^{2}\right)
$$

where $u$ is in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $r$ is in m . The average velocity, the flow rate, and the Reynolds number are

$$
\begin{aligned}
V & =V_{\text {avg }}=\frac{u_{\max }}{2}=\frac{6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}{2}=3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
\dot{V} & =V_{\text {avg }} A_{c}=V\left(\pi D^{2} / 4\right)=(3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})\left[\pi(0.04 \mathrm{~m})^{2} / 4\right]=3.77 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s} \\
\operatorname{Re} & =\frac{\rho V D}{\mu}=\frac{\left(1252 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right)(3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})(0.04 \mathrm{~m})}{0.3073 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{~s}}=488.9
\end{aligned}
$$

which is less than 2300 . Therefore, the flow is indeed **laminar**. Then the **friction factor** and the **head loss** become

$$
\begin{aligned}
f & =\frac{64}{\operatorname{Re}}=\frac{64}{488.9}=0.1309 \\
h_{L} & =f \frac{L V^{2}}{D 2 g}=0.1309 \frac{(70 \mathrm{~m})}{(0.04 \mathrm{~m})} \frac{(3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{2\left(9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}=105.1 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

The energy balance for steady, incompressible one-dimensional flow is given by Eq. 8-28 as

$$
\frac{P_{1}}{\rho g}+\alpha_{1} \frac{V_{1}^{2}}{2 g}+z_{1}+h_{\text {pump, u }}=\frac{P_{2}}{\rho g}+\alpha_{2} \frac{V_{2}^{2}}{2 g}+z_{2}+h_{\text {turbine, e }}+h_{L}
$$

For **fully developed flow** in a **constant diameter pipe** with no **pumps or turbines**，it reduces to

$$
\Delta P=P_{1}-P_{2}=\rho g\left(z_{2}-z_{1}+h_{L}\right)
$$

Then the pressure difference and the required useful pumping power for the horizontal case become

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta P & =\rho g\left(z_{2}-z_{1}+h_{L}\right) \quad \text { Or }\left(\Delta P=\rho g h_{L}\right) \text { for horizontal pipe } \\
& =\left(1252 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right)\left(9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(0+105.1 \mathrm{~m})\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{kPa}}{1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{~s}^{2}}\right) \\
& =1291 \mathrm{kPa} \\
 \dot{W}_{\text {pump, u }}&=\dot{V} \Delta P=\left(3.77 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s}\right)(1291 \mathrm{kPa})\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~kW}}{\mathrm{kPa} \cdot \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s}}\right)=4.87 \mathrm{~kW}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Example2: Pressure Drop and Head Loss in a Pipe

Water at $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(\rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right.$ and $\left.\mu=1.519 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}\right)$ is flowing steadily through a $0.3-\mathrm{cm}$ diameter $9-\mathrm{m}$-long horizontal pipe at an average velocity of $0.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ (Fig. 8-18). Determine (a) the head loss, (b) the pressure drop, and (c) the pumping power requirement to overcome this pressure drop.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_10_example2.JPG" alt="example2" width="100%" align="center">

**Properties**: The density and dynamic viscosity of water are given to be $\rho= 1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ and $\mu=1.519 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}$, respectively.

**Analysis**: 
1. First we need to determine the flow regime. The Reynolds number is

$$
\operatorname{Re}=\frac{\rho V_{\operatorname{avg}} D}{\mu}=\frac{\left(1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right)(0.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})(0.003 \mathrm{~m})}{1.519 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{~s}}=1777
$$

which is less than 2300 . Therefore, the flow is **laminar**. Then the friction factor and the head loss become

$$
\begin{aligned}
f & =\frac{64}{\mathrm{Re}}=\frac{64}{1777}=0.0360 \\
h_{L} & =f \frac{L}{D} \frac{V_{\text {avg }}^{2}}{2 g}=0.0360 \frac{9 \mathrm{~m}}{0.003 \mathrm{~m}} \frac{(0.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{2\left(9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}=4.46 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Noting that the pipe is **horizontal** and its **diameter is constant**, the **pressure drop** in the pipe is due entirely to the frictional losses and is equivalent to the **pressure loss**,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta P & =\Delta P_{L}=f \frac{L}{D} \frac{\rho V_{\text {avg }}^{2}}{2}=0.0360 \frac{9 \mathrm{~m}}{0.003 \mathrm{~m}} \frac{\left(1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right)(0.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{2}\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~N}}{1 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}\right) \\
& =43,740 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}=43.7 \mathrm{kPa}
\end{aligned}
$$

3. The volume flow rate and the pumping power requirements are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{V} & =V_{\text {avg }} A_{c}=V_{\text {avg }}\left(\pi D^{2} / 4\right)=(0.9 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})\left[\pi(0.003 \mathrm{~m})^{2} / 4\right]=6.36 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s} \\
\dot{W}_{\text {pump }} & =\dot{V} \Delta \mathrm{P}=\left(6.36 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s}\right)\left(43,740 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~W}}{1 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}\right)=\mathbf{0 . 2 8} \mathbf{W}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, power input in the amount of 0.28 W is needed to overcome the frictional losses in the flow due to viscosity.

**Discussion**: The pressure rise provided by a pump is often listed by a pump manufacturer in units of head (Chap. 14). Thus, the pump in this flow needs to provide 4.46 m of water head in order to overcome the irreversible head loss.

## Turbulent Flow in Pipes

Most flows encountered in engineering practice are **turbulent**, and thus it is important to understand how turbulence affects wall shear stress.

Turbulent flow is a complex mechanism dominated by **fluctuations**, and it is still not fully understood.

We must rely on experiments and the empirical or semi-empirical correlations developed for various situations.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_11_turbulent.JPG" alt="turbulent" width="100%" align="center">

The intense mixing in turbulent flow brings fluid particles at different momentums into close contact and thus enhances **momentum transfer**.

Turbulent flow is characterized by **disorderly and rapid fluctuations** of swirling regions of fluid, called **eddies**, throughout the flow.

These fluctuations provide an additional mechanism for momentum and energy transfer.

In turbulent flow, the swirling eddies transport mass, momentum, and energy to other regions of flow much more rapidly than molecular diffusion, greatly enhancing mass, momentum, and heat transfer.

As a result, turbulent flow is associated with **much higher values of friction, heat transfer, and mass transfer coefficients**

### Turbulent Velocity Profile

<img src="/fluid_tf4_12_lvst.JPG" alt="laminar vs turbulent" width="100%" align="center">

- **viscous sublayer**: The very thin layer next to the wall where viscous effects are dominant is the viscous (or **laminar** or **linear** or **wall**) sublayer
  - The velocity profile in this layer is very nearly linear
- **buffer layer**: Next to the viscous sublayer is the buffer layer, in which **turbulent effects** are becoming significant, but the flow is still **dominated by viscous effects**
- **overlap layer**: Above the buffer layer is the **overlap** (or **transition**) **layer**, also called the **inertial sublayer**, in which the turbulent effects are much more significant, but still not dominant
- **turbulent layer**: Above that is the outer (or turbulent) layer in the remaining part of the flow in which **turbulent effects** dominate over molecular diffusion (viscous) effects

The velocity profile in fully developed pipe flow is parabolic in laminar flow, but **much fuller** in turbulent flow. Note that $u(r)$ in the turbulent case is the **time-averaged** velocity component in the **axial direction** (the overbar on $u$ has been dropped for simplicity).

### The Moody Chart and the Colebrook Equation

**Colebrook Equation** (turbulent flow for smooth and rough pipes):

$$
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} = -2.0\log\left(\frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.7} + \frac{2.51}{\operatorname{Re}\sqrt{f}}\right)
$$

- The friction factor in fully developed turbulent pipe flow depends on the **Reynolds number** and the **relative roughness** $\varepsilon/D$. 
- The friction factor is minimum for a smooth pipe $(\varepsilon/D=0)$ and increases with roughness
- The Colebrook equation is implicit in $f$ since $f$ appears on both sides of the equation. It must be solved iteratively.

Here is the **Moody Chart**. It presents the Darcy friction factor for pipe flow as a function of Reynolds number and $\varepsilon/D$ over a wide range.

### Types of Fluid Flow Problems

1. Determining the **pressure drop** (or head loss) when the pipe length and diameter are given for a specified flow rate (or velocity)
2. Determining the **flow rate** when the pipe length and diameter are given for a specified pressure drop (or head loss)
3. Determining the **pipe diameter** when the pipe length and flow rate are given for a specified pressure drop (or head loss)

<img src="/fluid_tf4_15_3.JPG" alt="3 problems" width="100%" align="center">

To avoid tedious iterations in head loss, flow rate, and diameter calculations, these explicit relations (Swamee-Jain formula) that are accurate to within 2 percent of the Moody chart may be used:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
& h_L=1.07 \frac{\dot{V}^2 L}{g D^5}\left\{\ln \left[\frac{\varepsilon}{3.7 D}+4.62\left(\frac{\nu D}{\dot{V}}\right)^{0.9}\right]\right\}^{-2} \quad 10^{-6}<\varepsilon / D<10^{-2} \quad 3000<\operatorname{Re}<3 \times 10^8 \\ 
& \dot{V}=-0.965\left(\frac{g D^5 h_L}{L}\right)^{0.5} \ln \left[\frac{\varepsilon}{3.7 D}+\left(\frac{3.17 v^2 L}{g D^3 h_L}\right)^{0.5}\right] \quad \operatorname{Re}>2000 \\ & D=0.66\left[\varepsilon^{1.25}\left(\frac{L \dot{V}^2}{g h_L}\right)^{4.75}+\nu \dot{V}^{9.4}\left(\frac{L}{g h_L}\right)^{5.2}\right]^{0.04} \quad 10^{-6}<\varepsilon / D<10^{-2} \quad 5000<\operatorname{Re}<3 \times 10^8
\end{aligned}
$$

### Example3: Determining the Head Loss in a Water Pipe

Water at $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(\rho=999 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right.$ and $\left.\mu=1.138 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}\right)$ is flowing steadily in a 5 -cm-diameter horizontal pipe made of stainless steel at a rate of $6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{s}$ (Fig. 8-32). Determine the pressure drop, the head loss, and the required pumping power input for flow over a $60-\mathrm{m}$-long section of the pipe.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_16_example3.JPG" alt="example 3" width="100%" align="center">

**Properties**: The density and dynamic viscosity of water are given $999 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ and $\mu=1.138 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}$, respectively.

**Analysis**: We recognize this as a problem of the first type, since flow rate, pipe length, and pipe diameter are known. First we calculate the average velocity and the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V & =\frac{\dot{V}}{A_{c}}=\frac{\dot{V}}{\pi D^{2} / 4}=\frac{0.006 \mathrm{~m}^{3}}{\pi(0.05 \mathrm{~m})^{2} / 4}=3.06 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
\operatorname{Re} & =\frac{\rho V D}{\mu}=\frac{\left(999 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right)(3.06 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})(0.05 \mathrm{~m})}{1.138 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{~s}}=134,300
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $\operatorname{Re}$ is greater than $4000$, the flow is **turbulent**. The relative roughness of the pipe is estimated using Table 8-2

<img src="/fluid_tf4_17_tab_rough.JPG" alt="table for roughness" id="tab8-2" width="100%" align="center">

$$
\varepsilon / D=\frac{0.002 \mathrm{~mm}}{50 \mathrm{~mm}}=0.000040

The **friction factor** corresponding to this relative roughness and Reynolds number is determined from the Moody chart. To avoid any reading error, we determine $f$ from the Colebrook equation on which the Moody chart is based:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=-2.0 \log \left(\frac{\varepsilon / D}{3.7}+\frac{2.51}{\operatorname{Re} \sqrt{f}}\right) \\
  \rightarrow& \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=-2.0 \log \left(\frac{0.000040}{3.7}+\frac{2.51}{134,300 \sqrt{f}}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$

Using an equation solver or an iterative scheme, the friction factor is determined to be $f=0.0172$. Then the pressure drop (which is equivalent to pressure loss in this case), head loss, and the required power input become

$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{aligned}
\Delta P=\Delta P_{L}=f \frac{L}{D} \frac{\rho V^{2}}{2} & =0.0172 \frac{60 \mathrm{~m}}{0.05 \mathrm{~m}} \frac{\left(999 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right)(3.06 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{2}\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~N}}{1 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}\right) \\
& =96,540 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}=96.5 \mathrm{kPa} \\
h_{L}=\frac{\Delta P_{L}}{\rho g}=f \frac{L}{D} \frac{V^{2}}{2 g} & =0.0172 \frac{60 \mathrm{~m}}{0.05 \mathrm{~m}} \frac{(3.06 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{2\left(9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}=9.85 \mathrm{~m} \\
\dot{W}_{\text {pump }}=\dot{V} \Delta P & =\left(0.006 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s}\right)\left(96,540 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~W}}{1 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}\right)=579 \mathrm{~W}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, power input in the amount of $579 \mathrm{~W}$ is needed to overcome the frictional losses in the pipe.

**Discussion**: It is common practice to write our final answers to three signififrictional digits, even though we know that the results are accurate to at most two significant digits because of inherent inaccuracies in the Colebrook equation, as discussed previously. 


### Example4: Determining the Diameter of an Air Duct [core]

Heated air at 1 atm and $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is to be transported in a $150-\mathrm{m}$-long circular plastic duct at a rate of $0.35 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s}$ (Fig. 8-33). If the head loss in the pipe is not to exceed 20 m , determine the minimum diameter of the duct.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_18_example4.JPG" alt="table for roughness" width="100%" align="center">

**Properties**: The density, dynamic viscosity, and kinematic viscosity of air at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ are $\rho=1.145 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}, \mu=1.895 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}$, and $\nu=1.655 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$.

**Analysis**: This is a problem of the third type since it involves the determination of diameter for specified flow rate and head loss. We can solve this problem using three different approaches: 

1. an iterative approach by assuming a pipe diameter, calculating the head loss, comparing the result to the specified head loss, and repeating calculations until the calculated head loss matches the specified value;
2. writing all the relevant equations (leaving the diameter as an unknown) and solving them simultaneously using an equation solver; and 
3. using the third Swamee-Jain formula. We will demonstrate the use of the last two approaches.

The average velocity, the Reynolds number, the friction factor, and the head loss relations are expressed as ( $D$ is in $\mathrm{m}, V$ is in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$, and $\operatorname{Re}$ and $f$ are dimensionless)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{Re} & =\frac{V D}{\nu}=\frac{V D}{1.655 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} & =-2.0 \log \left(\frac{\varepsilon / D}{3.7}+\frac{2.51}{\operatorname{Re} \sqrt{f}}\right)=-2.0 \log \left(\frac{2.51}{\operatorname{Re} \sqrt{f}}\right) \\
h_{L} & =f \frac{L}{D} \frac{V^{2}}{2 g} \quad \rightarrow \quad 20 \mathrm{~m}=f \frac{150 \mathrm{~m}}{D} \frac{V^{2}}{2\left(9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$

The roughness is approximately zero for a plastic pipe ([Table 8-2](#tab8-2)). Therefore, this is a set of four equations and four unknowns, and solving them with an equation solver such as EES gives

$$
D=0.267 \mathrm{~m}, \quad f=0.0180, \quad V=6.24 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \quad \text { and } \quad \operatorname{Re}=100,800
$$

Therefore, the diameter of the duct should be more than $26.7 \mathrm{~cm}$ if the head loss is not to exceed $20 \mathrm{~m}$ . Note that $\operatorname{Re}>4000$, and thus the turbulent flow assumption is verified.

The diameter can also be determined directly from the third Swamee-Jain formula to be

$$
\begin{aligned}
D & =0.66\left[\varepsilon^{1.25}\left(\frac{L \dot{V}^{2}}{g h_{L}}\right)^{4.75}+\nu \dot{V}^{9.4}\left(\frac{L}{g h_{L}}\right)^{5.2}\right]^{0.04} \\
& =0.66\left[0+\left(1.655 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\right)\left(0.35 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s}\right)^{9.4}\left(\frac{150 \mathrm{~m}}{\left(9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(20 \mathrm{~m})}\right)^{5.2}\right]^{0.04} \\
& ={0 . 2 7 1} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Example5: Determining the Flow Rate of Air in a Duct

Reconsider Example4. Now the **duct length is doubled** while its **diameter is maintained constant**. If the total head loss is to remain constant, determine the drop in the flow rate through the duct.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_18_example4.JPG" alt="table for roughness" width="100%" align="center">

**SOLUTION**: The diameter and the head loss in an air duct are given. The drop in the flow rate is to be determined.

**Analysis**: This is a problem of the second type since it involves the determination of the flow rate for a specified pipe diameter and head loss. The solution involves an iterative approach since the flow rate (and thus the flow velocity) is not known.

The average velocity, Reynolds number, friction factor, and the head loss relations are expressed as ( $D$ is in $\mathrm{m}, V$ is in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$, and $\operatorname{Re}$ and $f$ are dimensionless)

The average velocity, Reynolds number, friction factor, and the head loss relations are expressed as ( $D$ is in $\mathrm{m}, V$ is in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$, and $\operatorname{Re}$ and $f$ are dimensionless)

$$
\begin{aligned}
V & =\frac{\dot{V}}{A_{c}}=\frac{\dot{V}}{\pi D^{2} / 4} \quad \rightarrow \quad V=\frac{\dot{V}}{\pi(0.267 \mathrm{~m})^{2} / 4} \\
\operatorname{Re} & =\frac{V D}{\nu} \quad \rightarrow \quad \operatorname{Re}=\frac{V(0.267 \mathrm{~m})}{1.655 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} & =-2.0 \log \left(\frac{\varepsilon / D}{3.7}+\frac{2.51}{\operatorname{Re} \sqrt{f}}\right) \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=-2.0 \log \left(\frac{2.51}{\operatorname{Re} \sqrt{f}}\right) \\
h_{L} & =f \frac{L}{D} \frac{V^{2}}{2 g} \quad \rightarrow \quad 20 \mathrm{~m}=f \frac{300 \mathrm{~m}}{0.267 \mathrm{~m}} \frac{V^{2}}{2\left(9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is a set of four equations in four unknowns and solving them with an equation solver such as EES gives

$$
\dot{V}=0.24 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s}, \quad f=0.0195, \quad V=4.23 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \quad \text { and } \quad \operatorname{Re}=68,300
$$

Then the drop in the flow rate becomes

$$
\dot{V}_{\text {drop }}=\dot{V}_{\text {old }}-\dot{V}_{\text {new }}=0.35-0.24=\mathbf{0 . 1 1} \mathrm{m}^{3} / \mathrm{s} \quad(\text { a drop of } 31 \text { percent })
$$

Therefore, for a specified head loss (or available head or fan pumping power), the flow rate drops by about $31$ percent from $0.35$ to $0.24 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{s}$ when the duct length doubles.

## Minor Losses

The fluid in a typical piping system passes through various **fittings, valves, bends, elbows, tees, inlets, exits, enlargements**, and **contractions** in addition to the pipes.

These components interrupt the smooth flow of the fluid and cause additional losses because of the flow separation and mixing they induce.



::: warning minor losses
In a typical system with long pipes, these losses are minor compared to the head loss in the straight sections (the **major losses**) and are called **minor losses**
:::

<img src="/fluid_tf4_20_minor.JPG" alt="figure for minor losses" width="100%" align="center">

For a constant-diameter section of a pipe with a minor loss component, the loss coefficient of the component (such as the gate valve shown) is determined by **measuring the additional pressure** loss it causes and dividing it by the dynamic pressure in the pipe.

Minor losses are usually expressed in terms of the loss coefficient $K_L$:

$$
  K_L = \frac{h_L}{V^2/(2g)}.
$$

where $h_L$ is **head loss** due to component, and is defined as $h_L=\Delta P_L / \rho g$.

When the inlet diameter equals the outlet diameter, the loss coefficient of a component can also be determined by measuring the pressure loss across the component and dividing it by the dynamic pressure

$$
  K_L = \Delta P_L / (\rho V^2/2)
$$

When the loss coefficient for a component is available, the head loss for that component is determined from **minor loss**:

$$
  h_L = K_L\frac{V^2}{2g}
$$

Minor losses are also expressed in terms of the **equivalent length** $L_{\mathrm{equiv}}$:

$$
  h_L = K_L\frac{V^2}{2g} = f\frac{L_{\mathrm{equiv}}}{D}\frac{V^2}{2g} \implies L_{\mathrm{equiv}} = \frac{D}{f}K_L
$$

<img src="/fluid_tf4_21_length.JPG" alt="figure for equivalent length" width="100%" align="center">

The head loss caused by a component (such as the angle valve shown) is **equivalent** to the head loss caused by a section of the pipe whose length is the **equivalent length**.

### Total head Losses

Once the loss coefficients are available, the total head loss in a piping system is determined from:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  h_{L,\mathrm{total}} &= h_{L,\mathrm{major}} &&+ \quad h_{L,\mathrm{minor}} \\
  &= \sum_i f_i\frac{L_i}{D_i}\frac{V_i^2}{2g} &&+ \quad \sum_j K_{L,j}\frac{V_i^2}{2g}
\end{aligned}
$$

Sudden Expansion: All the kinetic energy of the flow is “lost” (turned into thermal energy) through friction as the jet decelerates and mixes with ambient fluid downstream of a submerged outlet.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_24_sudden_expansion.JPG" alt="Figure for sudden expansion" width="100%" align="center">

The losses during changes of direction can be **minimized** by making the turn “easy” on the fluid by using **circular arcs** instead of sharp turns.

### Example6: Head Loss and Pressure Rise during Gradual Expansion

A 6-cm-diameter horizontal water pipe expands gradually to a 9-cm-diameter pipe (Fig. 8-43). The walls of the expansion section are angled $10^{\circ}$ from the axis. The average velocity and pressure of water before the expansion section are $7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $150 \mathrm{~kPa}$ , respectively. Determine the head loss in the expansion section and the pressure in the larger-diameter pipe.

<img src="/fluid_tf4_27_example6.JPG" alt="Figure for example6" width="100%" align="center">

**Assumptions** 
1. The flow is steady and incompressible. 
2. The flow at sections 1 and 2 is fully developed and turbulent with $\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2} \cong 1.06$.

**Properties**: We take the density of water to be $\rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. The loss coefficient for a gradual expansion of total included angle $\theta=20^{\circ}$ and diameter ratio $d / D=6 / 9$ is $K_{L}=0.133$ (by interpolation using Table 8-4).

**Analysis**: Noting that the density of water remains constant, the downstream velocity of water is determined from conservation of mass to be

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \dot{m}_1 = \dot{m}_2 \to \rho V_1A_1 &= \rho V_2A_2 \to V_2 = \frac{A_1}{A_2}V_1 = \frac{D_1^2}{D_2^2}V_1 \\
  V_2 &= \frac{(0.06\mathrm{~m})^2}{(0.09\mathrm{~m})^2}(7\mathrm{~m/s}) = 3.11\mathrm{~m/s}
\end{aligned}
  $$

Then the irreversible head loss in the expansion section becomes

$$
h_{L}=K_{L} \frac{V_{1}^{2}}{2 g}=(0.133) \frac{(7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{2\left(9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)}=0.333 \mathrm{~m}
$$

Noting that $z_{1}=z_{2}$ and there are no pumps or turbines involved，the energy equation for the expansion section is expressed in terms of heads as

$$
\frac{P_{1}}{\rho g}+\alpha_{1} \frac{V_{1}^{2}}{2 g}+\not z_{1}+h_{\text {pump }, u}(=0)=\frac{P_{2}}{\rho g}+\alpha_{2} \frac{V_{2}^{2}}{2 g}+\not z_{2}+h_{\text {turbine, } e} (=0)+h_{L}
$$

or

$$
\frac{P_{1}}{\rho g}+\alpha_{1} \frac{V_{1}^{2}}{2 g}=\frac{P_{2}}{\rho g}+\alpha_{2} \frac{V_{2}^{2}}{2 g}+h_{L}
$$

Solving for $P_{2}$ and substituting，

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{2}= & P_{1}+\rho\left\{\frac{\alpha_{1} V_{1}^{2}-\alpha_{2} V_{2}^{2}}{2}-g h_{L}\right\}=(150 \mathrm{~kPa})+\left(1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right) \\
& \times\left\{\frac{1.06(7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}-1.06(3.11 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}}{2}-\left(9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)(0.333 \mathrm{~m})\right\} \\
& \times\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~kN}}{1000 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~kPa}}{1 \mathrm{~kN} / \mathrm{m}^{2}}\right) \\
= & 168 \mathrm{~kPa}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore，despite the head（and pressure）loss，the pressure increases from $150$ to $168 \mathrm{~kPa}$ after the expansion．This is due to the conversion of dynamic pressure to static pressure when the average flow velocity is decreased in the larger pipe.
